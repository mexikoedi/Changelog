#Changelog 12.2 from 24.07.2020#

removed:

added:

server settings:

information:
updated the code, workshop/ingame icons and descriptions/name for my all my addons, also uploaded all addons to github
cleaned the server cache and other things to force the server to redownload everything - small performance improvement and maybe some weird things are now fixed
performance benchmark results: 

"benchmark"
{
	"framerate"		"127.640579"
	"build"		"7891"
}

Over 50% performance improvements to the last test that was taken in march. - Reached because of the many improvements that were made until now.
The "framerate" is the server framerate and not your client framerate! 
(If you get lags then it's because of your client framerate or because of an network lag from you and/or the server, a server lag should not happen, even if one happens it should be a minimal and short lag.)
